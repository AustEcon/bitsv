Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why Python 3 only?
------------------

1. Python 3 has faster ``int`` <-> ``bytes`` conversion.
2. The official (really this time) EOL for Python 2 is the year 2020.
3. Polyglot is messy.

How so fast?
------------

BitSV uses Bitcoin's heavily
optimized C library `electrumsv-secp256k1 <https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv-secp256k1>`_
for all elliptic curve operations.

Why GitHub Pages instead of ReadtheDocs?
----------------------------------------

GitHub Pages has better page load times and is a bitcash more reliable. Also,
not only does `GitHub itself`_ use it, but other large projects like `React`_,
`Bootstrap`_, etc. do too.

I consider GitHub more future-proof.
